    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Howdy ya'll! It's ThotBusterNo1, aka Zeke! So little thing to know about me is that I am college dropout and have
        this little dream of getting out of debt and make a shit ton of money! Currently learning front-end web development
    and sort of failing at it. You won't see any javascript here (not yet at least) but I am trying my best to get out multiple
situtations. Currently have a lot of video ideas for you in the future but it is just gonna be Mash On Wakeup Quest for now.
    </p>
