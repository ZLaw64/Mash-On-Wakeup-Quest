    <h2>Janurary 17th, 2022</h2>
    <p>As of this writing, I have recorded 30% of the script for the first episode, Enterbrain FG Maker 2002. The video
        consist of 2 games, Angels of Battle and Super Cosplay War Ultra. The video is mainly rambly and hope I didn't 
    make it hard to understand and entertaining enough for folks, as attention spans are slowly decreasing, including mines.
The hard part is finding time to record the audio and recording the game. Since the engine, Fighting Game Maker 2002 has
such limiting training mode options, it is hard to explain certain concepts. The goal was to release the video by the end of the 
month but it is going to be hard with motivation, time, and all that jazz. I'll keep it the progress, especially since I hit this
brick wall multiple times. Short update but I will soon get things running.</p>
